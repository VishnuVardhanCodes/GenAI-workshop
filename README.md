# GenAI Workshop Assignments

This repository contains all the hands-on assignments completed during the 5-day Generative AI workshop conducted by Aurora Higher Education. The assignments cover practical examples using Python, LangChain, and Ollama, focusing on logging, chaining, parallel execution, and branching workflows with LLMs.

## Workshop Overview
- Day 1-5: Progressive learning with real use cases and LangChain programs
- Usage of TinyLlama and Ollama integration for efficient AI workflows
- Emphasis on foundational skills for generative AI application development

## How to Use 
- Review each script file for detailed examples and comments
- Run Python files locally after installing dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Extend or customize workflows to build your own GenAI projects

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.13
- LangChain
- Ollama LLM models (TinyLlama)
- Logging and workflow orchestration techniques

Feel free to explore, contribute, and build on these exercises to enhance your AI development skills!
