# GenAI Workshop Assignments
This repository contains the complete hands-on assignments from the 5-day Generative AI workshop held at Aurora Higher Education University. The workshop focused on practical learning and application of modern generative AI techniques using Python, LangChain, and Ollama.

## Workshop Overview
Over five days, participants learned the foundations of generative AI, large language model orchestration, and automation through progressive coding assignments and real-world use cases.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to logging and handling dependencies in Python projects
- Building prompt chains and reusable workflows with LangChain
- Running parallel AI tasks using Runnable Parallel
- Conditional branching workflows with Runnable Branch
- Integration with Ollama and usage of TinyLlama models
- Best practices for orchestrating large language models in production environments

## How to Use
- Review individual Python scripts in the `Day3` folder for detailed examples
- Ensure necessary dependencies are installed via `requirements.txt`
- Customize and extend these workflows for your own generative AI projects
